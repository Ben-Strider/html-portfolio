<h1>The top films, according to Ben</h1>
    <h2>Here are my favourite three movies</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Prestige</h3>
    <p>A Chris Nolan masterpiece - this film is incredibly interesting while you don't understand what is happening, then on subsequent rewatches the film becomes even more fascinating. The star-studded cast is just the cherry on top.</p>

<h3>Drive</h3>
    <p>This film really got me to appreciate Ryan Gosling as an actor, and that's before we even talk about the incredible vibe this movie gives off. Between the cinematography and the soundtrack the film is a joy to watch, and the story is gripping throughout. Just don't do a disservice to this film by watching the terrible "BBC Radio One rescore"!</p>

<h3>Sicario</h3>
    <p>While on the surface only a simple action piece, this film really shocked me with its emotional character moments performed by great actors, a compelling story, and buitiful camera composition. While not the greatest film Denis Villeneuve has directed, it was the film that introduced me to his work.</p>
